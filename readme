Twitter Sentiment Analysis - "Radeon"

This is a project where the Twitter API was used to extract tweets using a search word.
The search word for this project was 'Radeon'.

Radeon is the name of AMD discrete video cards. The Radeon search word was used to analyze the tweets during the GPU shortage
due to the crypto mining phaze.

Most of the results were from bots posting links to restockings of the video cards. The majority of people relly on some sort of 
social media to find resellers.

After filtering the results, I applied a sentiment analysis algorithm to analyze the words and tweets being used in the sampled tweets.
Most of the results were neutral or positive since the tweets were sponsoring a restock.
